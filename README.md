This is what you can make your Undertale Fangame ideas come true.

> We value Game's Perfect Environment.

To make this engine run perfectly in Low-End PCs, We're trying our best to optimize our codes as much as possible.

> We protect You, Developer's codes.

Messy codes? Precious codes? All of them are easily stolen by UndertaleModTool, but no worry!
We are finding a way to block your codes. So no one will be able to steal your codes. (Unless they can read disassembly codes, then there is this next feature that might help)
Don't want people to steal your assets? Don't want people to mod your games for fun/to cheat?
Fear not, the anti-export and save corruption is already a built-in feature of this engine, if people want to steal your protected assets or mod some protected codes, they will experience an error instead!

## Branch Purposes:

> Canary : This will be getting the cutting edge updates, which means most likely it will cause unexpected errors or crashes.

> Stable : When the feature is **completly** done and stable, It will move to the Stable branch.

> Long-Term Support : Specified for GameMaker LTS users! This branch will barely get updates. Its purposes are to maintain stability.

You are on the Canary branch, This branch will have very unstable, reliable builds. Yeah, most likely.

If you're lucky, you may get at least an useful build.
