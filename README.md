This is what you can make your Undertale Fangame ideas come true.

> We value Game's Perfect Environment.

To make this engine run perfectly in Low-End PCs, We're trying our best to optimize our codes as much as possible.

> We protect You, Developer's codes.

Messy codes? Precious codes? All of them are easily stolen by UndertaleModTool, but no worry!
We are finding a way to block your codes. So no one will be able to steal your codes.

These github projects will be seperated like:
> Canary : This will be getting everyday-update, which means most likely it will cause unexpected errors or crashes.
> Dev : When the feature is 60% finalized, It will move to the Dev branch.
> Stable : When the feature is **completly** done, It will move to the Stable branch.

You are on the Canary branch, This branch will have very unstable, reliable builds. Yeah, most likely.
If you're lucky, you may get at least an useful build.
